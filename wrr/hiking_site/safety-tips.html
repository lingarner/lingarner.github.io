                        Arizona is infamous for it's intense heat- especially in the summer, because of 
                        this hiking becomes all the more dangerous. Hydration during this kind of 
                        heat is critical to survival. The amount of water that a hike requires varies from hike to hike depending
                        on intensity, length and the fitness level of the participant; however, a good rule of Thumb
                        is to carry amount two liters of water at the minimum. If one is hiking in the intense summer months 
                        (June-August), it is recommended to bring an additional liter or even just a couple extra water bottles.
                        A surprisingly good tip is to bring chapstick on the trail. When one is trying to conserve water, chapstick can 
                        provide a great sense of relief without drinking too much water.

                    It is popular to take furry friends along on cool hiking adventures
                    however it can be dangerous for them to spend excessive time
                    outdoors in higher temperatures, so make sure you understand 
                    your pet's abilities and pay attention to their behavior. Pets heat 
                    up and cool off differently than humans, so don't base their health 
                    level on how you're feeling. Your own animals are not the only creature you 
                    need to keep and eye on in the desert-scape, filled with rattlesnakes, scorpions, and 
                    venomous lizards the desert is not always kind to visitors. Make sure to keep your pets on a leash
                    if only to protect them from investigating wildlife that would rather be left alone. If you see (or hear) a 
                    rattlesnake make sure to keep your distance.

                    Planning is an essential part to any journey. A few critical parts of a safe adventure
                    is studying up on your route. Sites like AllTrails.com or HikeArizona.com provide platforms 
                    for other people to share their experience on the trails. Visiting these sites provides a great 
                    opportunity to learn about the trail and learn from the experiences of other hikers. Knowing where your going
                    and knowing what to expect is a must for any adventure. Knowing the length and intensity of the hike you are planning on 
                    is important for both food and water preparation. A common motto is prepare for the worst but expect the best. 
                    Depending on the location of your hike, make sure you keep an eye on the weather and keep in mind how it will affect the trail.
