      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever found yourself scrolling through social media, 
          seeing all your friends having a blast on some outdoor adventure 
          and wishing you had the know-how to do the same? As an avid adventurer myself, 
          I understand how frustrating it can be to find information on hikes. 
          I can create a platform that provides all the information necessary 
          to have a new successful and safe adventure.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> This website is catering mainly to beginner hikers but also the occasional 
        hardcore hikers. These people are anywhere from their late twenties to mid-forties,
        even people with a little younger family. All are mainly interested in having a good 
        time and enjoying Arizona's beauty. This site should be mainly accessed by laptop or 
        desktop computers because that is where planning adventures and trips is made easier.

        The first step in any adventure is knowing where you want to go. Fortunately,
        there are a plethora of websites that offer in depth descriptions of hikes, backpacks etc. 
        This site is designed to help you start your adventure and help you find a challenging 
        adventure while maintaining your safety. There are many other sites that you might consider 
        visiting after this one (ex. AllTrail.com or hikearizona.com) which will provide you with in depth details
        about trails and helpful reviews from adventurers who crave the experiences of the outdoors, just like you.

      <h3>Dangers/Preparations</h3>
      <p>
        <b><p>Weather</p></b>
        When planning any outdoor excursion, something that is often neglected is the <b>weather</b>. 
        This can be an extremely costly mistake, especially in the desert area that is Arizona. 
        The summer is the most dangerous, as temperatures can reach anywhere from ninety degrees to 
        one-hundred and seven degrees. In cases like this the biggest asset you can have in your pack is extra water. 
        There are stories on stories of hikers dying due to dehydration (books like Death in the Grand Canyon). 
        Dehydration is one of, if not the most, common affliction Arizona adventurers suffer from. However, the intense
        heat is not the only danger overlooked; desert wildlife also provides a large threat to your hiking safety. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><p>Creatures</p></b>
        Rattlesnakes, scorpions, and gila monsters are all current Arizona residents and need to be treated with extreme caution.
        As tourists of the desert landscape, hikers often lose brain function and invade the <b>creatures’</b> personal space 
        in a dangerous picture attempt. By both limiting these interactions and using the zoom function of one’s camera 
        the main danger of these animals is easily avoided. Although to be safe keep a first-aid kit close at hand and 
        be sure to keep up to date on venom removal processes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><p>Planning</p></b>
          Planning is critical. This knowledge is universal across all forms of outdoor 
          undertakings in any location, and Arizona is no different. Thanks to the technology of today, the opportunities to thoroughly
          investigate one’s trail information is easily accessible.

      <h3>Hiking Trails</h3>
      <p>
        Despite popular belief, Arizona is not only filled with miles of rolling sand dunes 
        and the occasional scrub brush. Through the different regions of Arizona, one can 
        experience anything from pine filled forests to deep canyons to cacti covered mountains. 
        As a friendly warning, hikes suggested here are not toddler friendly and are suggested for older groups. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <p><b>
        Flatiron, Apache Junction-
        </p></b>
      Located in Lost Dutchman State Park in Apache Junction, Arizona, Flatiron is a well traveled trail. 
      Its close proximity to town provides a very convenient place for people to experience a challenging
      trail near home. About five and a half to six miles round trip this hike fits in nearly three thousand 
      feet of elevation gain in a very short period of time. While this trail is popular the trail can get very 
      confusing because for the second half it is mostly bouldering up a drainage. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <p><b>
        Bear Mountain, Sedona-
        </p></b>
        Sedona Arizona is known for its beautiful hikes and stunning rock layers/formations. Bear Mountain 
        is one of the lesser traveled trails in the area as it’s near four thousand feet of elevation gain is 
        intimidating to most tourists. It is similar to Flatiron in mileage as it is about five miles. However, 
        the stunning views from it’s peak are worth the sweat.
        The internationally recognized Grand Canyon resides in the state of Arizona, and as one of the seven natural
        wonders of the world has to be mentioned. Not only are the views from the rim of the canyon spectacular, but 
        heading down the trails provides an entirely new and fresh perspective of this phenomenon.
