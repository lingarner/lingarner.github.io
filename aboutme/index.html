    Hi guys! I'm a freshman at BYU-I and this is my second semester.
    Right now, I am majoring in mathematical sciences but I took my first 
    programming class last semster and it got me excited about software 
    engineering! 
    Born and raised in Gilbert, Arizona it goes without saying that I 
    am a little 
    apprehensive about the current weather in Rexburg.

    I've been a member of the church all my life and I have grown to love this
    gospel and everyone apart of it.

    Growing up, my family went hiking all the time so naturally 
    it has become a huge part of my life and something I love to do. In fact, 
    most outdoor activities I truly enjoy.
